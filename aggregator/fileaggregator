In this updated version, a new constant DONE_FOLDER is added, which represents the path to the folder where you want to move the aggregated files.

After the aggregation process and saving the aggregated files to the output folder, the route includes an additional to("file:" + DONE_FOLDER) statement, which moves the processed files to the "done" folder.

Remember to replace path/to/done/folder with the actual path to your desired "done" folder.

Once again, ensure that you have the Apache Camel library in your classpath to execute this code successfully.
