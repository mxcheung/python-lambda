To schedule an AWS Lambda function to run weekly, you can use AWS CloudWatch Events (formerly known as CloudWatch Events Rules) in combination with AWS Lambda. Here are the steps to set up a weekly schedule for your Lambda function:

# Create or Select Your Lambda Function:
If you haven't already, create the Lambda function that you want to schedule. If you already have a Lambda function, note down its ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

# Create a CloudWatch Event Rule:
This rule will trigger your Lambda function on a weekly schedule.

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the CloudWatch service.
In the CloudWatch dashboard, click "Rules" on the left sidebar.
Click the "Create rule" button.

# Create a Schedule for Your Rule:
In the "Create Rule" page:

In the "Event Source" section, select "Event Source: Schedule".
Under "Cron expression," you can specify the schedule using a cron expression. A cron expression for running something weekly on a specific day and time might look like this:

```
cron(0 0 ? * 1 *)
```

This expression runs the rule every Sunday at midnight UTC (0:00 on Sunday).
You can use an online cron expression generator to create a schedule that suits your needs.

# Add a Target:
This is where you specify your Lambda function as the target to be triggered by the rule.

In the "Targets" section, click "Add target."
In the "Function" dropdown, select your Lambda function.
Configure Details:
Give your rule a name and optional description. You can also specify the state of the rule (enabled or disabled).

# Create Rule:
After you have configured all the necessary details, click the "Create rule" button to create your schedule.

Your AWS Lambda function will now be triggered on the schedule you specified. Make sure to test the schedule to ensure it's working as expected.

Keep in mind that AWS Lambda charges you based on the number of requests and the time your function is running. So, ensure that your Lambda function is designed to handle the required workload efficiently and cost-effectively.

Additionally, the cron expression provided in this example is in UTC. Make sure to adjust it to your desired timezone if needed.
