The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌──->──┐
|  securityConfig (field private org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2RestTemplate com.abnamro.clearing.oidc.auth.config.SecurityConfig.restTemplate)
└──<-──┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
